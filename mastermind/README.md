Logic for Building the Game:
As a programmer, you would need to implement the following components:

1.Generating the Secret Code:
Create a function that generates a random sequence of code peg colors according to the game's rules.

2.Handling Guesses and Feedback:
Allow the Codebreaker to input their guess.

3.Compare the guessed code with the secret code to determine the black and white key peg feedback.
Game Loop:
Implement a loop that allows the Codebreaker to make multiple guesses until they either win or run out of attempts.

4.End Game Conditions:
Check whether the Codebreaker has guessed the secret code correctly or has used up all their attempts to decide the game's outcome.

5.User Interface (Optional):
You can build a graphical or text-based interface to make the game playable and enjoyable.

  # def getCode()
    #     puts "#{@name} please enter your 4-digit code [NOTE: if entered34 more than 4-digits it will reduce to the first 4]"
    #     operating_code = []
    #     until operating_code.length == 4
    #         puts"Please enter your digits again!"
    #         operating_code = gets.chomp.to_s.split('')
    #     end
    #     return operating_code
    #     p 'returned'
    # end
